  Using the Cosign project, OCI images may be signed to ensure supply chain security is maintained. Those signatures can be verified before pulling into a cluster. This policy checks the signature of an image repo called docker.io/mohdcode/kyverno to ensure it has been signed by verifying its signature against the provided public key. This policy serves as an illustration for how to configure a similar rule and will require replacing with your image(s) and keys.
