version: 1.0.0
displayName: Disallow Service Type LoadBalancer in ValidatingPolicy
description: >-
  Especially in cloud provider environments, a Service having type LoadBalancer will cause the provider to respond by creating a load balancer somewhere in the customer account. This adds cost and complexity to a deployment. Without restricting this ability, users may easily overrun established budgets and security practices set by the organization. This policy restricts use of the Service type LoadBalancer.
install: |-
