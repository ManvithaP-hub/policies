description: >-
  In some cases you would need to trust custom CA certificates for all the containers of a Pod. It makes sense to be in a ConfigMap so that you can automount them by only setting an annotation. This policy adds a volume to all containers in a Pod containing the certificate if the annotation called `inject-certs` with value `enabled` is found.
