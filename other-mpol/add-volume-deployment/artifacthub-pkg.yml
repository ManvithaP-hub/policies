description: >-
  Some Kubernetes applications like HashiCorp Vault must perform some modifications to resources in order to invoke their specific functionality. Often times, that functionality is controlled by the presence of a label or specific annotation. This policy, based on HashiCorp Vault, adds a volume and volumeMount to a Deployment if there is an annotation called "vault.k8s.corp.net/inject=enabled" present.
