description: >-
  The sidecar pattern is very common in Kubernetes whereby other applications can insert components via tacit modification of a submitted resource. This is, for example, often how service meshes and secrets applications are able to function transparently. This policy injects a sidecar container, initContainer, and volume into Pods that match an annotation called `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: true`.
