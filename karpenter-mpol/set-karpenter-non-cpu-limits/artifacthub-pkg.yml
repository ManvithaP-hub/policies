displayName: Set non-CPU limits for pods to work well with Karpenter
createdAt: "2023-06-02T16:29:50.000Z"
description: >-
  For correct node provisioning Karpenter should know exactly what the non-CPU resources are 
  that the pods will need. Otherwise Karpenter will put as many pods on a node as possible, 
  which may lead to memory pressure on nodes. This is especially important in consolidation mode.
